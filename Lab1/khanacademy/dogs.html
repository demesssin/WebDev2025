<p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a <strong><em>domesticated descendant
    of the wolf.</em></strong>

    it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves,
    during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers</p>

<h1> Dog song! </h1>
<p class = "song-lyrics"> <strong>On the meadow, dogs are running,<br>
    Tails are wagging, so stunning.<br>
    Barking loud, a cheerful choir,<br>
    Every pup, a ball of fire. <br><br>

    Chasing sticks and catching balls,<br>
    Rain or shine, they love it all.<br>
    Leaping high, so full of glee,<br>
    Dreaming big, as wild as can be.<br><br>

    Happy, tired, yet so bright,<br>
    Eyes aglow with pure delight.<br>
    Oh, dear dogs, youâ€™re our friends,<br>
    With you, the joy just never ends!</strong></p>
